### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
summary_table <- cars %>%
   summarise(
    mean_speed = mean(speed),
    mean_distance = mean(dist)
  )


```


```{r paged.print=FALSE}
kable(summary_table, 
      digits = 2, 
      col.names = c("Speed", "Distance")) |>
  kable_classic() |>
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, font_size = 20) 
```


```{r}
summary_table %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling()
```


```{r cars}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(cars)

```
